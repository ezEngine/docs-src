# Getting Started

If you are completely new to ezEngine and only want to take a quick look, download the latest [prebuilt binaries](binaries.md).

However, releases are done only infrequently, and once you want to properly work with the engine, you are expected to build it yourself from the latest dev branch.

## Building

For build instructions, see [Building ezEngine](../docs/build/building-ez.md).

## Samples

As a next step, have a look at [the samples](../samples/samples-overview.md). The [Monster Attack Sample](../samples/monster-attack/monster-attack.md) showcases most of the game functionality. The [PacMan Sample](../samples/pacman.md) is a good introduction to make a simple game, because it is accompanied by a video, walking you through the basic steps.

The [Store Sample](../samples/store-sample.md) showcases how a game could look with decent assets.

You can also create your own project and use the [Basic FPS Project Template](../samples/basic-fps-template.md) to have a running shooter game within seconds.

Finally, the [Testing Chambers](../samples/testing-chambers.md) project contains various scenes showcasing different functionality. Don't be surprised by how crappy they look, it's all programmer's art.

## Videos

The [ezEngine YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ezEngine) demonstrates various aspects of the engine. Since the engine is constantly being improved, some vidoes are somewhat outdated, but still contain valuable information.

The [videos](videos.md) page has a selection of videos that might be interesting to start with.

## Importing Assets

Once you want to bring your own assets into the engine, check out [how to import assets](../docs/assets/import-assets.md).
