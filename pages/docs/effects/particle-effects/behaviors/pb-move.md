# Move Behavior

This behavior moves particles along the X, Y or Z axis. The movement can be constant or controlled by a curve over the particle's lifetime.

**MoveAxis:** The axis along which to move the particles. Can be set to X, Y or Z.

**Speed:** A constant speed at which to move particles along the selected axis. This is useful for simple upward or sideways movement.

**SpeedCurve:** A [curve](../../../animation/common/curves.md) that controls the movement speed over the particle's lifetime. This allows for more dynamic movement patterns, such as acceleration or deceleration over time.
