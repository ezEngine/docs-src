## Questions and Discussions

For questions that are not covered by the documentation, please see [the forum](https://github.com/ezEngine/ezEngine/discussions). We will try to answer as quickly as possible, but be aware that we don't always have the time to answer right away, and that we may be in a different time-zone than you (GMT+1). 

We are also reachable via Discord. Use this link to join the server: [https://discord.gg/rfJewc5khZ](https://discord.gg/rfJewc5khZ)

> **NOTE:**
>
> Our community is *very* small at the moment and many questions can only reasonably be answered by the EZ developers. Please don't spam the Discord channel with general C++ or build setup questions that could be answered with a web search or by reading [the available documentation](docs/docs-overview.md).
