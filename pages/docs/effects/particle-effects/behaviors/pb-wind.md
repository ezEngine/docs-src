# Wind Behavior

This behavior applies [wind](../../wind/wind-overview.md) forces to particles. If the scene contains wind, this behavior will push particles in the wind direction.

**WindInfluence:** Specifies how much the wind affects the particles. A value of 0 means no wind influence, while higher values make particles more responsive to wind forces.
