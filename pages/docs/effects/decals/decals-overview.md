# Decals Overview

Decals are a way to project textures onto surfaces in your scene. They're useful for adding detail like dirt, scratches, bullet holes, or other surface imperfections without modifying the underlying geometry.

## Decal Types

EZ provides different types of decals for various use cases:

* **[Decals](projected-decals.md)** - Standard projected decals
* **[Mesh Decals](mesh-decals.md)** - Decals that use mesh geometry
