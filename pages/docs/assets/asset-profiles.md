# Asset Profiles

Asset profiles are used to make project configurations for each platform. For example, on PC a different rendering pipeline may need to be used than on Android.

## Modify asset profiles

Under *Editor > Project Settings > Asset Profiles* you can open the **asset profiles** dialog. At the top you can select for which platform you want to make modifications.

<!-- PAGE IS TODO -->

Asset profiles are fully functional, but currently undocumented.
