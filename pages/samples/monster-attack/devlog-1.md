# MA Devlog 1 - Intro

For some reason the next two weeks I have more spare time than usual. So I decided to use this time to try to make a demo that is a bit more elaborate. And I decided to mention this here, so that I have more reasons to actually continue working on it. You know, I'm more of a technical person, and doing "game development" quickly becomes boring to me. I prefer to write the systems behind the scenes. Anyway, this project is limited to two weeks anyway, so let's see how far I get.

Since I'm bad at game design, I need something that's already designed. So I chose to do a tower defense game. More specifically, a clone of [Orcs Must Die!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orcs_Must_Die!),  a game that is a lot of fun (though I only know part 1 and 2).

The nice thing about this game is, that the core mechanic is relatively quick to implement, but then there are lots and lots of details that can be added over time.

In the past few days I've set up some basics of the project, gathered some assets (from <https://quaternius.com> and <https://kenney.nl>) and implemented the basic character controller and monster functionality. So I now have a simple level layout and some monsters that run from the start point to the end point:

You can also already shoot and kill the monsters:
