# Build Prerequisites

We try to keep the number of prerequisites to build ezEngine as small as possible. However, the following software must be obtained and installed separately:

## CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used as the build system. Version 3.12 or newer is required.

## FMOD (optional)

EZ supports [FMOD](../sound/fmod-overview.md) for sound. If you want to enable FMOD support, register with FMOD and then download the "FMOD Studio API 2.x installer" and install it.
