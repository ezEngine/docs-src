# Visual Script: CVar Nodes

## CVar

CVar nodes allow you to read and write [console variables (CVars)](../../debugging/cvars.md) from within visual scripts. CVars are configuration values that can be modified at runtime through the console, making them useful for debugging, testing, and exposing tunable parameters.

Use CVar nodes to:

* **Read CVar values** - Access configuration settings and debug flags
* **Write CVar values** - Modify settings programmatically based on game state
* **Dynamic configuration** - Change behavior without recompiling
* **Debug controls** - Toggle features or adjust parameters during development

CVars are particularly useful during development for tweaking gameplay values, enabling debug features, or testing different configurations. They can also be used to expose user settings that players can modify through the console.
