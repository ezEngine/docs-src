# Visual Script: Sound Nodes

## Sound

Sound nodes provide functionality to trigger audio playback from within visual scripts. These nodes allow you to play sound effects and control audio in response to game events.


Sound nodes are commonly used for playing footsteps, weapon sounds, UI feedback, environmental audio, and any other sound effects that need to be triggered dynamically based on script logic.
