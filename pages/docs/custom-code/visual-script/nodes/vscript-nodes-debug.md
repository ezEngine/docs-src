# Visual Script: Debug Nodes

## Debug

Debug nodes provide functionality for [debug rendering](../../debugging/debug-rendering.md), allowing you to visualize information directly in the game viewport. These nodes are invaluable for understanding game logic, troubleshooting issues, and verifying that scripts are working as expected.

Common debug rendering operations:

* **Draw shapes** - Render lines, boxes, spheres, and other geometric primitives
* **Draw text** - Display debug information in 3D space or on screen
* **Visualize vectors** - Show directions, normals, and rays
* **Temporary visuals** - Create visual aids that only appear during development

Debug rendering is visible in both the editor and game viewports and can be toggled on/off through the [debug rendering system](../../debugging/debug-rendering.md). Use debug nodes liberally during development to visualize raycasts, AI decisions, trigger volumes, or any other abstract concepts that are hard to understand without visual feedback.

Combine debug nodes with [logging nodes](vscript-nodes-log.md) for comprehensive debugging capabilities.
