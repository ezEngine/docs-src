# Rope Render Component

The *rope render component* is used to render a rope. The current implementation renders a simple, black line. More options will follow.

The rope simulation is done by other components, such as the [PhysX rope component](../physics/special/physx-rope-component.md). The rope render component has to be attached to the same object as the simulation component.
