# Script Component

<!-- PAGE IS TODO -->

## Component Properties

`HandleGlobalEvents`: If enabled, this component acts as a [Global Event Message Handler](../../runtime/world/world-messaging.md#global-event-message-handlers). This is useful for scripts that should implement logic for an entire level.

`Script Class`:

`Parameters`: In case the referenced script has [exposed parameters](../../scenes/exposed-parameters.md), they are being listed here and can be modified. When the script gets instantiated, the values of these parameters are passed into the script. Modifying the values after the script was started currently has no effect.
