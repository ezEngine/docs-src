# Samples

Sample data is mostly stored in the [Content](https://github.com/ezEngine/content) git sub-module. If any data is missing, make sure your git sub-module is updated (`git submodule update`).

Some samples may come purely as data (editor projects). Other samples require custom code. Sample code is generally only available if the CMake build switch **EZ_BUILD_SAMPLES** is set. Make sure to compile all sample projects, if you want to try them out.

## Getting Started

The [Testing Chambers](testing-chambers.md) project is a good start point to see what you can do purely through the editor and using scripting. No custom C++ code is used in this project.

If you want to see how you can extend the engine with your own C++ code through a plugin, have a look at the [Sample Game Plugin](sample-game-plugin.md) or the [RTS Sample](rts.md). The former shows just the basics to get your own code running. The latter goes a bit further and shows how you can make a simple game.
