# API Docs

## Online

The C++ API documentation is available online at [**ezEngine.GitHub.io/api-docs**](https://ezengine.github.io/api-docs).

Please be aware that the search functionality on the website is very limited, it only finds items when their name starts with what you searched for. So for example to find the documentation for the `ezGameState` class, you have to type *ezgamest* to show any results, typing *gamest* without the *ez* prefix will show no results.

## Generating the Docs locally

If you need the latest source documentation, you can generate the Doxygen documentation locally. A *Doxyfile* is available in the `Documentation` folder of the repository.
