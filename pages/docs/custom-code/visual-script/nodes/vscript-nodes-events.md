# Visual Script: Event Handler Nodes

## Event Handlers

Event handlers are nodes that get executed when a certain [message](../../../runtime/world/world-messaging.md) is sent to any of the objects that this script is responsible for. All event handlers are *entry points* into the script and most scripts will only execute as a reaction to an event.
