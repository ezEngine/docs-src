# Visual Script: Physics Nodes

## Physics

Physics nodes provide access to the [Jolt physics engine](../../../physics/jolt/jolt-overview.md) from within visual scripts. These nodes allow you to perform physics queries, apply forces, and interact with physics actors and shapes.

Common physics operations include:

* **Raycasting** - Cast rays to detect collisions and find objects
* **Overlap queries** - Check for objects within a specific area or shape
* **Force application** - Apply forces and impulses to dynamic physics actors
* **Physics queries** - Query physics properties and collision information

These nodes are essential for gameplay mechanics that involve physics interactions, such as shooting, throwing objects, detecting ground contact, or implementing custom physics-based behaviors. Use them in combination with [dynamic actors](../../../physics/jolt/actors/jolt-dynamic-actor-component.md), [triggers](../../../physics/jolt/actors/jolt-trigger-component.md), and [collision shapes](../../../physics/jolt/collision-shapes/jolt-shapes.md).
