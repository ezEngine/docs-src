# Visual Script: Game Object Nodes

## Game Object

[Game object](../../runtime/world/game-objects.md) nodes provide functionality for working with game objects in the scene hierarchy. These nodes allow you to navigate the object tree, manipulate transforms, and access components.

Common game object operations:

* **Transform access** - Read and write position, rotation, and scale
* **Hierarchy navigation** - Find parent and child objects, search by name
* **Component access** - Get components attached to game objects
* **Object state** - Check if objects are active, valid, or tagged
* **Object creation** - Spawn and destroy game objects dynamically

Game object nodes are fundamental to most visual scripts, as they allow you to locate and manipulate objects in the scene. Use them together with [component nodes](vscript-nodes-component.md) to access specific functionality, and [prefab nodes](vscript-nodes-prefabs.md) to instantiate new objects.
